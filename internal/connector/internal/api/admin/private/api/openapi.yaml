        schema:
          type: string
      - description: |-
          Specifies the order by criteria. The syntax of this parameter is
          similar to the syntax of the `order by` clause of an SQL statement.
          Each query can be ordered by any of the `ConnectorType` fields.
          For example, to return all Connector types ordered by their name, use the following syntax:

          ```sql
          name asc
          ```

          To return all Connector types ordered by their name _and_ version, use the following syntax:

          ```sql
          name asc, version asc
          ```

          If the parameter isn't provided, or if the value is empty, then
          the results are ordered by name.
        examples:
          orderBy:
            value: name asc
        explode: true
        in: query
        name: orderBy
        required: false
        schema:
          type: string
        style: form
      - description: |
          Search criteria.

          The syntax of this parameter is similar to the syntax of the `where` clause of a
          SQL statement. Allowed fields in the search are `name`, `description`, `version`, `label`, and `channel`.
          Allowed operators are `<>`, `=`, or `LIKE`.
          Allowed conjunctive operators are `AND` and `OR`. However, you can use a maximum of 10 conjunctions in a search query.

          Examples:

          To return a Connector Type with the name `aws-sqs-source` and the channel `stable`, use the following syntax:

          ```
          name = aws-sqs-source and channel = stable
          ```[p-]

          To return a Kafka instance with a name that starts with `aws`, use the following syntax:

          ```
          name like aws%25
          ```

          If the parameter isn't provided, or if the value is empty, then all the Connector Type
          that the user has permission to see are returned.

          Note. If the query is invalid, an error is returned.
        examples:
          search:
            value: name = aws-sqs-source and channel = stable
        explode: true
        in: query

          Specifies the order by criteria. The syntax of this parameter is
          similar to the syntax of the `order by` clause of an SQL statement.
          Each query can be ordered by any of the `ConnectorType` fields.
          For example, to return all Connector types ordered by their name, use the following syntax:

          ```sql
          name asc
          ```

          To return all Connector types ordered by their name _and_ version, use the following syntax:

          ```sql
          name asc, version asc
          ```

          If the parameter isn't provided, or if the value is empty, then
          the results are ordered by name.
        examples:
          orderBy:
            value: name asc
        explode: true
        in: query
        name: orderBy
        required: false
        schema:
          type: string

          Search criteria.

          The syntax of this parameter is similar to the syntax of the `where` clause of a
          SQL statement. Allowed fields in the search are `name`, `description`, `version`, `label`, and `channel`.
          Allowed operators are `<>`, `=`, or `LIKE`.
          Allowed conjunctive operators are `AND` and `OR`. However, you can use a maximum of 10 conjunctions in a search query.

          Examples:

          To return a Connector Type with the name `aws-sqs-source` and the channel `stable`, use the following syntax:

          ```
          name = aws-sqs-source and channel = stable
          ```[p-]

          To return a Kafka instance with a name that starts with `aws`, use the following syntax:

          ```
          name like aws%25
          ```

          If the parameter isn't provided, or if the value is empty, then all the Connector Type
          that the user has permission to see are returned.

          Note. If the query is invalid, an error is returned.
        examples:
          search:
            value: name = aws-sqs-source and channel = stable
        explode: true
