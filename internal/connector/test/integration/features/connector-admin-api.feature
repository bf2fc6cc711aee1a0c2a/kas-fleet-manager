Feature: connector admin api
  In order to support the service
  As an Admin API user
  I need to be able to manage the service

  Background:
    Given the path prefix is "/api/connector_mgmt"

    # users with fleet role
    Given an admin user named "Ricky Bobby" with roles "cos-fleet-manager-admin-full"

    # org admins
    Given an org admin user named "Stuart Admin" in organization "13640240"
    Given an org admin user named "Kevin Admin" in organization "13640241"

    # regular users
    Given a user named "Regular Bob"
