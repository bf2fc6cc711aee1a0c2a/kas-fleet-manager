# Adding diagrams using [mermaid](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid)

If diagrams are needed, you can either create them using the tools you like to use, or you can use [mermaid](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid) to generate diagrams using Markdown-like syntax.

Unfortunately preview of mermaid diagrams is not supported by Github yet. There are supposed to be some [browser extension](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/integrations?id=browser-extensions) to make it work, but they doesn't seem to be able to render the diagrams correctly in PR views. So for now we will use generated images instead.

To add a diagram generated by mermaid, you should:

1. Add the mermaid Markdown file in the [mermaid-diagrams-source](./mermaid-diagrams-source) directory. Make sure the filename is using `.mmd` extension.
2. In the root of the project, run the following command:
    ```
    make docs/generate/mermaid
    ```
    It will download the [mermaid CLI docker container](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli) and generate the diagrams.
3. Insert the image to your doc.
