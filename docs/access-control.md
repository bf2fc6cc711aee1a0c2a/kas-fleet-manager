# Access Control 
## Deny List Configurations

Users can be denied access to the service explicitly by adding their usernames in 
[the list of denied users](../config/deny-list-configuration.yaml).

The username is the account in question.

>NOTE: Once a user is in the deny list, all Dinosaurs created by this user will be deprovisioned.
