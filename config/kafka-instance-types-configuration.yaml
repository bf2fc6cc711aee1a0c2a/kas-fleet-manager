# This configuration defines a list of supported Kafka instance types and their associated configuration for KAS Fleet Manager.
# Modify this file to add additional Kafka instance types or change the default values listed below.
# 
# The following properties must be defined for each Kafka instance type:
#   - id: Identifier for the Kafka instance type. Each instance type name should be unique.
#   - display_name: human readable value of an instance type
#   - [required] supported_billing_models: a list of available kafka billing models for the instance type. Cannot be empty
#   - sizes: A list of sizes available for this instance type (should not be an empty list)
#
# The following properties are available in each element in the supported_billing_models list:
#   - [required] id: Identifier for the Kafka billing model. Must be unique among all supported_billing_models
#   - [required] ams_resource: AMS resource to be used. Accepted values: ['rhosak']
#   - [required] ams_product: AMS product to be used. Accepted values: ['RHOSAK', 'RHOSAKTrial', 'RHOSAKEval', 'RHOSAKCC']
#   - [required] ams_billing_models: List of AMS available billing models: Accepted values: ['standard', 'marketplace', 'marketplace-rhm', 'marketplace-aws']
#   - [optional] grace_period_days: The length of time in days when a Kafka instance is set to be in a 'grace period'. Default value: 0, minimum value: 0
#  
#                                   A Kafka instance enters a 'grace period' when a user or an organisation's subscription is no longer valid 
#                                   (i.e. subscription in AMS is not active or is no longer available). 
#                                   During this grace period, the Kafka instance status changes to 'suspended'. The only actions a user can perform are to:
#                                      1. Renew their subscription
#                                      2. Promote their Kafka instance to use an active subscription of another Kafka billing model (if the option is available)
#                                   If the subscription has not been renewed or the Kafka instance has not been promoted by the end of the grace period, the 
#                                   Kafka instance expires and is marked for deletion.
# 
#                                   If this field is not specified or is set to 0, Kafka instances with this instance type and billing model are not given
#                                   any grace period. In this case, when the user or organisation's subscription is no longer valid, the Kafka instance 
#                                   expires (marked for deletion) immediately.
#                                   
#                                   Please note that lifespanSeconds takes precedence over this configuration if its specified for the instance type. 
#                                   E.g. An instance type has a lifespanSeconds of 172800 (2 days) and the kafka billing model has a grace period of 10 days.
#                                   If the subscription expires 1 day after the Kafka instance was created, it will be set to expire (marked for deletion)
#                                   2 days after its creation date without fully completing the 10 day grace period.
#
# The following properties must be defined for each size (all values must be larger than '0'):
#   - id: The size identifier. Each size id should be unique.
#   - display_name: human readable value of the instance size
#   - ingressThroughputPerSec: Maximum limit for ingress throughput per second (MB/s).
#   - egressThroughputPerSec: Maximum limit for egress throughput per second (MB/s).
#   - totalMaxConnections: Maximum client connections allowed.
#   - maxConnectionAttemptsPerSec: Maximum client connection attempts per second.
#   - maxDataRetentionSize: Maximum storage (GB).
#   - maxDataRetentionPeriod: Maximum duration(ISO8601) for retaining data.
#   - maxPartitions: Maximum partitions for all topics combined.
#   - maxMessageSize: Maximum message size (MB)
#   - minInSyncReplicas: Minimum number of in sync replicas
#   - replicationFactor: Replication factor
#   - supportedAZModes: a list of the supported AZ modes. The possible values are "single", "multi"
#   - [optional] lifespanSeconds: The limit lifespan of the kafka instance in seconds.
#                                 This attribute is applied at kafka creation time. It is
#                                 used to calculate the date at which a kafka instance expires.
#                                 Updates to this attribute will not impact the already existing kafka instances.
#                                 If not specified then the instance never expires as a cause of the
#                                 lifespanSeconds attribute.
#                                 Accepted values: 1..N
#   - quotaConsumed: Quota consumed for selecting this size for a Kafka instance.
#   - [deprecated] quotaType: Quota type that will be consumed when this size is selected. This field is
#                             now deprecated and it is ignored. Configure supported_billing_models at instance-type level instead
#   - capacityConsumed: Data plane cluster capacity consumed by this Kafka instance size (only used for manual scaling)
