# A list of allowed users given by their usernames irrespective whether they are under an organisation or not.
# For now, this only supports RH username or service account at the moment. 
# In the future it may support users outside RH. For example, when testing, you can add your account
# via `allowed_users_per_organisation` entry, if the account isn't already inside any of the organisations in the organisations list
# The structure of allowed users is:
#       - username: is the account of the user. The username must be unique
#       - max_allowed_instances: is the maximum number of instances this user can create. 
#         Defaults to the global value of `max-allowed-instances` which has different values for distinct environments. 
allowed_users: []

# A list of allowed users per organisation (see structure below). The list current contains three organisations - add yours if it is missing.  
# - "id": is the organisation id

# - "allowed_users": A list of allowed users (see structure below) for this organisation. If empty, no one is allowed unless "allow_all" is set to true. 
#       - username: is the account of the user. The username must be unique within the organisation and across organisations.
#       - max_allowed_instances: is the maximum number of instances this user can create. 
#         Defaults to the global value of `max-allowed-instances` which has different values for distinct environments.
