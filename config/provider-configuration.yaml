# This file contains the configuration for cloud providers supported by KAS Fleet Manager
# KAS Fleet Manager will allow for Kafkas to be created using the cloud provider(s) and region(s) listed here.
# 
# Note that enterprise clusters registered via /api/kafkas_mgmt/v1/clusters endpoint (cluster_type="enterprise") are not taken into consideration 
# when using this configuration and limits defined here are not applicable for kafkas to be created on enterprise clusters
#
# supported_instance_type: This contains a map of Kafka instance types supported
# by the cloud provider and region. KAS Fleet Manager will not allow you
# to create any Kafka instance with a type that is not listed here. The attributes
# of each value in the supported_instance_type map are:
#   - [optional] limit: Limit in number of streaming units
#     If not specified, there is no limit enforced at region level.
#     Accepted values: [0-n]
#   - [optional] min_available_capacity_slack_streaming_units: Minimum capacity
#     in number of kafka streaming units that should be available (free) at any
#     given moment for a supported instance type in a region.
#     If not specified, its default value is 0 which means that there is
#     no minimum available capacity required.
#     Accepted values: [0-n] where n <= limit.

#     Used for dynamic scaling evaluation.
#
# Example configuration of a `regions` element:
#   ...
#   - name: us-east-1
#     supported_instance_type:
#         standard:
#           limit: 5
#           min_available_capacity_slack_streaming_units: 3
#         developer: {}
#   ...
#
#   With the above configuration, up to 5 'standard' Kafka instances can be created in the us-east-1 region. Since there is no region limit set for 'developer',
#   KAS Fleet Manager will allow creation of 'developer' Kafka instances in the us-east-1 region as long as a data plane cluster is available in this region
#   (i.e. is schedulable, has remaining capacity and supports this Kafka instance type)
#
#   Note: If manual scaling is enabled, please ensure that the limits you configure here matches/must not exceed the kafka_instance_limits of your data
#         plane clusters in the dataplane-cluster-configuration.yaml file
