# This file contains an OpenShift template that creates a route helping to
# directly access the service in the development environment.
#
# This route uses a self signed certificate certificate for the wildcard
# `*.apps-crc.testing', generated using the following command:
#
# openssl req \
# -x509 \
# -newkey rsa:4096 \
# -keyout my.key \
# -nodes \
# -out my.crt \
# -subj '/CN=*.apps-crc.testing' \
# -days 3650
#
# Note that the CaCertificate is the same value as the Certificate
#
# In production no such route exists, all access is through gateway.
