# OCM Example Service (SD-B)
---

This project is an example OCM microservice.

To help you while reading the code the service implements a sinmple collection
of _dinosaurs_, so you can inmediatelly know when something is infrastructure or
business logic. Anything that talks about dinosaurs is business logic, which you
will want to replace with your our concepts. The rest is infrastructure, and you
will probably want to preserve without change.

For a real service written using the same infrastructure see the
https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/uhc-account-manager[Account Manager 
service].

To contact the people that created this infrastructure go to the
